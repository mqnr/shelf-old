# Shelf

Shelf is a CRUD program. It's the final project for Programaci√≥n II in my Software Engineering undergrad.

## Is it actually?

No. I wound up rewriting the whole thing from scratch, and didn't use this repo, though I didn't want to delete it.

## What is it supposed to do?

Manage magazines in a library setting.
